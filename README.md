********** WoW Texas Holdem v1.21 - Forked from Anzac Holdem ********** WoW Texas Holdem is a fully functional Texas Holdem Poker Mod that allows World of Warcraft players to play texas holdem with each other while in World of Warcraft. This mod provides users something to do while waiting for spawns, raiding, and while looking for a group.

We do not suggest playing for real money, or world of warcraft gold.

We were given permission to Fork Anzac Holdem. Please do not Fork WoW Texas Holdem or Anzac Holdem without permission from the creator.
